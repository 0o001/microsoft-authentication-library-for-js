# Roadmap

The MSAL.js team's roadmap is presented as near-term, mid-term, & long-term to give you a better idea of what we are currently working on, what is up next for us, and what we are considering for the future. These are not guaranteed timelines, but instead intended to provide insight into the team's current direction. The roadmap is focused on big features or focus areas; it may not call out each individual work item that is added to the library. While we try to stay consistent with our plans, things can change quickly. Do not write code reliant on these features until they are officially shipped.

If you have feature requests, please add a Github Issue with specifics of the [Feature Request](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-unconfirmed%2Cquestion&template=feature_request.yml).

## Terminology
- *Near Term*: These items are well-defined and actively in development.
- *Mid Term*: Next to be picked up for development when capacity allows. The problem space & solution are known but we may still be defining implementation details.
- *Long Term*: The team is investigating for the future but donâ€™t have a clear solution in mind. This is the area most in flux as investigations can change feasibility & priority.
