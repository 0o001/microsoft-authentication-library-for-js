<h1>MSAL.js Hybrid Flow sample</h1>

<p>This sample demonstrate how to perform the hybrid flow to login when performing server-side and client-side authentication. By obtaining the SPA auth code server-side and passing it to the MSAL <code>ssoSilent</code> API client-side, applications can remove a second request to the AAD <code>authorize</code> endpoint (which requires third-party cookies) to SSO client-side.</p>
